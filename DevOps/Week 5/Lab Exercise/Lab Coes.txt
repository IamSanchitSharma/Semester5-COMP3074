Lab Commands & More
 
Below you’ll find some of the commands we used in our lab this week along with some additional material for you to explore should curiosity prompt you to do so.
 
The additional resources found here; you will not be tested on nor required to complete. It’s only intended to make your work easier and to arm you with more industry knowledge.
 
Git
`git branch dep-incusions` - creates a branch for us to work in
`git checkout dep-inclusions` - switches us to track on that branch for changes
` git push  --set-upstream origin dep-inclusions ` - ensures our local branch work is pushed to GitHub on the respective branch
 
NPM
`npm install` - install npm project dependencies
`npm run build` - after npm dependencies are installed, build them
`npm run start` - once dependencies are built, start the application
